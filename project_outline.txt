Introduction

Welcome to the Contact Management System project! 
In this project, you will apply your Python programming skills to create a functional command-line-based application that simplifies the management of your contacts. 
You will be able to add, edit, delete, and search for contacts, all while reinforcing your understanding of Python dictionaries, file handling, user interaction, and error handling.

Project Requirements
Your task is to develop a Contact Management System with the following features:

User Interface (UI):
    Create a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for the Contact Management System.
    Display a welcoming message and provide a menu with the following options:

    Welcome to the Contact Management System! 
    Menu:
    1. Add a new contact
    2. Edit an existing contact
    3. Delete a contact
    4. Search for a contact
    5. Display all contacts
    6. Export contacts to a text file
    7. Import contacts from a text file *BONUS*
    8. Quit

Contact Data Storage:
    Use nested dictionaries as the main data structure for storing contact information.
    Each contact should have a unique identifier (e.g., a phone number or email address) as the outer dictionary key.
    Store contact details within the inner dictionary, including:

    1. Name
    2. Phone number
    3. Email address
    4. Additional information (e.g., address, notes).

Menu Actions:
    Implement the following actions in response to menu selections:

    1. Adding a new contact.
    2. Editing an existing contact's information (name, phone number, email, etc.).
    3. Deleting a contact.
    4. Searching for a contact and displaying their details.
    5. Displaying a list of all contacts.
    6. Exporting contacts to a text file in a structured format.
    7. Importing contacts from a text file and adding them to the system. * BONUS

User Interaction:
    1. Utilize input() to enable users to select menu options and provide contact details.
    2. Implement input validation using regular expressions (regex) to ensure correct formatting of contact information.

Error Handling:
    Apply error handling to manage unexpected issues that may arise during execution using these blocks:
    1. try
    2. except
    3. else
    4. finally  

GitHub Repository:
    Create a GitHub repository for your project.
    Create a clean and interactive README.md file in your GitHub repository.
    Include clear instructions on how to run the application and explanations of its features.

Optional Bonus Points:
    Contact Categories (Bonus): Implement the ability to categorize contacts into groups (e.g., friends, family, work). Each contact can belong to one or more categories.
    Contact Search (Bonus): Enhance the contact search functionality to allow users to search for contacts by name, phone number, email address, or additional information.
    Contact Sorting (Bonus): Implement sorting options to display contacts alphabetically by name or based on other criteria.
    Backup and Restore (Bonus): Add features to create automatic backups of contact data and the ability to restore data from a backup file.
    Custom Contact Fields (Bonus): Allow users to define custom fields for contacts (e.g., birthdays, anniversaries) and store this information.
